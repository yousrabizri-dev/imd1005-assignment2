**Name:** Yousra Albizri  
**Student Number:** 101392056  
**Course:** IMD1005 – Web Development

##  Client: 
The client is an emerging 2D animator, illustrator, and 3D environment artist (myself).  
They create small-scale creative work for indie creators, collaborators, and personal commissions, while also using the site as a professional portfolio for recruiters.

**Site Purpose:**  
The purpose of this website is to:
- Showcase creative work in a clear and professional way  
- Explain the services offered  
- Provide an easy way for potential clients and recruiters to make contact  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Changes from Assignment 1

In Assignment 1, the client was a fictional placeholder.  
For this assignment, I changed the client to myself as a real emerging artist and portfolio owner.

Design changes made from Assignment 1 include:
- Updating the brand identity and content to reflect my real work and services  
- Refining the layout to better support portfolio presentation  
- Improving clarity for two audiences: potential clients and recruiters  
- Adding a structured services section and a contact form to support commissions  

These changes were made to make the project more realistic, relevant to my goals, and aligned with how a real portfolio website would function.

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- HTML (semantic structure)
- CSS (Flexbox & Grid for layout)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)
- ChatGPT (used for learning support and small code snippets)

##  Image Credits

All images (other than the hero background) and artwork used in this project are my own original work, created for my portfolio.

AI tools were used to:
